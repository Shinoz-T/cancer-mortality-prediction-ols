# Cancer Mortality Rate Prediction

## Overview

This project involves building a multivariate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to predict cancer mortality rates across U.S. counties. The goal is to utilize various features to forecast mortality rates, aiding in understanding and potentially improving cancer-related health outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Model**: Multivariate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression
- **Performance**: Achieved an R-squared value of 89%, indicating strong model performance.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Plotly

## Data Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted to understand the dataset, identify trends, and detect outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Executed to enhance model performance and improve accuracy.

## Getting Started

To run the code and explore the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/Shinoz-t/cancer-mortality-rate-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```powershell
    cd cancer-mortality-rate-prediction
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the project script:
    ```powershell
    python regression_model.py
    ```
